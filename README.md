### Hey, I'm Samuel Kuria 👋🏽

> *“Everything I build is a piece of me trying to make sense of this messy, beautiful world.”*

I’m a builder of quiet things.  
A computer science student by degree — but more of a writer, thinker, and feeler trying to merge tech with truth.

- 🌍 Based in Kenya, shaped by code, community, and curiosity.
- 🎯 Currently building **IDENTIFIED**, a digital library of my mind — part blog, part journal, part revolution.
- 🧠 Learning: Frontend development with **React** & **Next.js**, a bit of **Python**, some **AI**, and lots of **why’s**.
- ✍🏽 Writing about identity, purpose, mental health, and tech. Sometimes with poetry. Sometimes with code.
- 🛠️ Working on projects like:
  - `Scatter`: a way to help ADHD brains try to organize notes.
  - `Flowstate`: a gamified way to help writers stay in the flow.
  - A voice-powered idea engine that turns raw thoughts into clarity.

I believe in making tools that don’t just work, but *mean* something.  
More life. And impact for our humanity.

If you're building something thoughtful, weird, or wildly human,let's talk.  
This README isn’t the whole story. But it’s a start.
